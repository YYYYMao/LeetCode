60. Permutation Sequence
=========================
The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

因為有時間的限制 所以用查詢會比較快
